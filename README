Sample program that uses the Monodoc.dll assembly to render
the system documentation.   The actual loading is very crude
right now, as this was done in merely 20 minutes of copying 
some features from the Gtk# monodoc browser.

This needs the latest version of MonoMac built from Git,
it wont work with the released versions, as I made some
API changes.
